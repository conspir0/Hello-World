# Hello Wolrd
>Welcome to my GitHhub profile. You can find some of my recent projects here. I have divided content in “Repositories” tab into three sections, for better readability and clarity.

## First Section (numbers from 1 to 9)
>You can find websites (mostly designed and coded by myself; two of them is inspired by PSD template). I’ve used: HTML, CSS/SASS, Bootstrap, RWD, Git.

## Second Section (numbers from 10 to 99)
>In this section I placed pure JS/jQuery projects. Used: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, RWD, wanilla JS, jQuery, Ajax, API, Git.

## Third Section (numbers from 100 to 999)
>Last section contains a few training projects (which isn’t and won’t be styled).

At the top of each subpage, I’ve added link to the live version. If you are curious and inquisitive visitor, you are the reason why I’ve provided more extensive descriptions (at the bottom).
